# Cybersecurity Journey üöÄ

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning repository! Here, I document my journey as I dive deeper into the world of cybersecurity, covering everything from networking fundamentals to advanced penetration testing and exploit development. This repository serves as both a personal reference and a resource for others looking to explore or expand their cybersecurity skills.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **Learning Modules**  
  Key topics and concepts in cybersecurity, broken down into manageable sections:
  - **Networking**: Basics, protocols, packet analysis, etc.
  - **Cryptography**: Hashing, encryption, decryption, and cryptographic tools.
  - **Web Security**: OWASP Top 10, SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.
  - **Malware Analysis**: Static and dynamic analysis techniques.
  - **System Security**: Hardening Linux, Windows security practices.
  
- **Scripts and Tools**  
  Custom scripts, modified tools, and automated scripts for tasks like scanning, fuzzing, and enumeration.

- **CTF Write-Ups**  
  Detailed write-ups for Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges and labs I've completed, showcasing the steps I took, tools used, and vulnerabilities found.

- **Projects**  
  Hands-on projects, such as building a mock vulnerable application, developing basic network sniffers, or writing custom exploits.

- **Resources and Study Notes**  
  Links, summaries, and notes on articles, videos, books, and courses that I've found helpful throughout my journey.

- **Blogs/Reflections**  
  Weekly or monthly reflections on my progress, challenges, and next steps.

## üîß Tools and Technologies

- **Operating Systems**: Kali Linux, Ubuntu, Windows
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Bash, C/C++
- **Cybersecurity Tools**: Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, SQLmap, Burp Suite, John the Ripper, etc.

## üìù CTF Platforms

I participate in CTF challenges on various platforms, including:
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)
- [Hack The Box](https://hackthebox.eu)
- [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org)
- [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org)

## üèÜ Goals

1. Develop a strong foundation in cybersecurity fundamentals.
2. Gain hands-on experience with various tools and techniques.
3. Build a portfolio of projects, CTF write-ups, and custom tools.
4. Work towards cybersecurity certifications (e.g., CompTIA Security+, CEH, OSCP).
5. Share insights and contribute to the cybersecurity community.
